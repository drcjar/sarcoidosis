# definition

Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disorder of unknown aetiology characterised by the prescence of noncaseating granulomas in involved organs. It typicaly affects young adults and initially presents with one or more of the following abnormalities:

- bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy
- pulmonary reticular opacities
- skin, joint, and/or eye lesions

# epidemiology

- approx 1 in 10,000 patients affected in UK
- can occur at any age but typically 30s or 40s
- f>m, african and scandinavian heritage > other heritages

# aetiology

- not well understood, likely interaction of genetic, immunologic, and environmental factors
- ?genetics - familial clustering; first-degree relatives are at increased risk for developing sarcoidosis (odds ratio [OR] 4.7, 95% CI 2.3-9.7)
- ?occupation - there is age-specific and sex-specific clustering; certain exposures e.g beryllium can cause granulomas similar to sarcoid granulomas
- ?infectious or environmental cause - there is seasonal clustering (more common winter, early spring); apparant transmission following lung, cardiac, and bone mx transplantation has occured

# pathology

- multisystem (usually non-caseating) granulomatous disease that involves lungs in 90% of cases
- affects upper lobes and bronchovascular bundles more than other lung compartments
- often associated with hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy
- immunopathogenesis: 
-- antigen stimulates monocyte to differenciate into antigen-presending cell (macrophage or dendritic cells). presented to CD4+ t-helper lymphocytes which amplify imnmune response through interferon-gamma, IL2, and other cytokines. Aided by tregs that also produce inteferon gamma.  Increased expression of the transcription factor T-bet and chemokine receptor CXCR3 contribute to a Th1 orientation. (Th1-type response, recall Th1 response predominantly manifest against intracellualr organisms, dominant cytokines IL2 and IFN gamma, while Th2-type response against extracellular organisms, dominant cytokine IL4).
-- further stimulation by inflamatory mediators leads to fusion of macrophages and dendritic cells into multinucleated giant cells, as granuloma matures these form a tight central cluster. metabolic checkpoint kinase (mTORC1) activation in macrophages is assoc with disease progression.
- TCR on CD4+ t-helper cells (predominant lymphocyte) could hold key to identifying antigen/understanding disease since they recognise processed antigen presented on MHCII complex. Enormous diversity of TCR acquired through somatic rearrangement of variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) segments togetehr with random addition and/or deletion of N-region nucleotides to form unique VDJ region. Studies of the TCR Vbeta repertoire in patients with active sarcoidosis has demonstrated bias in certain TCR Vbeta subsets, including Vbeta2, Vbeta8, Vbeta12, and Valpha2.3. (does it vary with antigen or with HLA class type? we don't know)
- Genome wide linkage and association studies have identified genes that may be associated with increased susceptibility to sarcoidosis, such as butyrophilin-like 2 gene (BTNL2), annexin A11 (ANXA11), and angiotensin converting enzyme variants, although the associations vary across populations.

# clinical features

## history

presentation depends on systems disease affect (90% involve lung, isolated BHL most common)
- node-limited disease is often asymptomatic; however, some present with systemic symptoms (fevers, night sweats, fatigue, weight loss, diffuse myalgia)
- BHL may accompany sarcoid uveitis, or parotitis
- Logren's syndrome consists of BHL, erythema nodosum and/or bilateral ankle arthritis
- parenchymal sardcoidosis may present with dyspnoea and cough
- non-cardiac chest pain is often characterised by chest tightness or pleuritic discomfort
- cough and exertional dyspnoea common in advanced sarcoidosis
- accuarate exposure adn occupational hisotry to exclude conditions that may present in a similar manner including berylliosis (eg, those working in the mining, quarrying or stonemasonry industry).

## examination 

- usually normal, occasional wheeze and stridor
- classical 'end-inspiratory' crackles are atypical but can occur if fibrosis is present
- digital clubbing is uncommon

## investigations

- bloods: fbc, u&e, lfts, calcium, ace, vitamin d (monitor regularly if supplement) (iron studies and tfts too if pt fatigued)
- ecg (+ echo - want TR velocity if suspect PH, 24h tape, CMR if suspect cardiac sarcoidosis)
- 24-hour urinary calcium estimation in those with history of renal calculi
- pfts, gas exchange
- CT chest
- EBUS-TBNA (pooled sensitiviy approx 80%, non-caseating granuloma, TB culture and PCR -ive) + BAL ('high volume' wash i.e 100-300ml to distal airspace, elevated lymphocyte count 15-25%, >50% suggests HP)

## diagnosis

- can make confident clinical diagnosis if typical presentation and imaging (i.e Lofgrens syndrome), otherwise HRCT and MDT discussion +/- EBUS-TBNA

## management and prognosis

- should signpost [patient information resources](https://www.blf.org.uk/support-for-you/sarcoidosis/what-is-it)

- ask about fatigue, consider using Fatigue Assessment Scale
- ask about cardiac symptoms: palpitation, chest pain, pre-syncope/syncope (investigate, echo and 24h tape at least)

- consider cardiac sarcoidosis and pulmonary hypertension (both approx 5-10% of gen sarcoid pop), consider in pt with breahtlessness disproportionate to PFTs 

- opthalmic review if any occular symptoms
- neurology review  if any central or peripheral nervous symptoms
- dematology reveiw if any skin lesions

- steroids only if there is 1. potential danger of a fatal outcome or permenant disability 2. unacceptable loss of quality of life
-- consider steroids when DLco < 65% or 15% drop from baseline, FVC < 70% or if 10% drop from baseline
-- typical regimen 20-40mg od for 4-6 weeks, tapering dose thereafter e.g 5mg every 2/52 to maintainance e.g 5-10mg/day (consider bone protection)
-- trial withdrawal of steroids after 6-12 months of controlled disease, risk of relapse 13-75%, most within a year (reduce from 5mg od by 1mg every 2 weeks to 1mg od, then 1mg od alternate days for 2 weeks).
- second-line immunosupression if 1. Progression of pulmonary disease or unacceptable symptom burden despite adequate steroid therapy. 2. Intolerable steroid side effects. 3. Inability to taper steroids below 10-15mg/day 4. Prescence of major comorbities likely to be adversely affected by steroid therapy (severe obesity, diabetes, osteoporisis, hypetension) 5. Strong patient aversion to use of steroids, may occasionally use second-line agent as initial therapy in this circumstance
-- methotrexate is most commonly used, typically initiate at 5-10mg per week and increment every two weeks to achieve target of 15-20mg per week, give folic acid 5mg weekly to reduce incidence of myelosupression (other options include mycophenolate, leflunomide, and azathioprine). (viral hepatitis screen necessary as heb B or C infection preclude)
- biologics and are third line ageents 
- lung transplant, consider referral significant acute (e.g 10% over 6/12) drop in FVC or DLco is association with respiratory failure

- management of fatigue, look for non-sarcoid cause, generic advice
- offer help with smoking cessation, anxiety, depression

- monitoring to 1. observe spontaenous resolution in recently diagnosed cases 2. look for progression or confirm improvement or stability in untreated patients 3. determine the effect of anti-inflammatory treatment 4. look for relapse in patients who are tapering or have discontinued therapy

- patients with Lofgren's syndrome or stage I chest x-ray (stage 0 normal, I enlarged nodes only, II enlarged nodes and parenchymal changes, III paranchymal changes without nodes or fibrosis, IV fibrosis) can be discharged from medical care once resolution confirmed, otherwise follow up 6 monthly or annually for stage II-IV, 3-6 monthly for significant extrapulmonary disease or steroid withdrawal.

- approx 40% of patients spontaenously remit in first 6/12 (if logren syndrome 70-80% remit within 2 years)
- approx 30% of sarcoid patients have clinically significant major organ involvment, long term mortality due to sarcoidosis is approx 20% for these (so overall approx 6%)
- pulmonary invovlement (ILD and/or pulmonary hypertension) is the cause in 70% sarcoidosis attributed deaths, rest cardiac
