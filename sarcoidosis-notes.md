# definition

Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disorder of unknown aetiology characterised by the prescence of noncaseating granulomas in involved organs. It typicaly affects young adults and initially presents with one or more of the following abnormalities:

- bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy
- pulmonary reticular opacities
- skin, joint, and/or eye lesions

# epidemiology

- approx 1 in 10,000 patients affected in UK
- can occur at any age but typically 30s or 40s
- f>m, african and scandinavian heritage > other heritages

# aetiology

- not well understood, likely interaction of genetic, immunologic, and environmental factors
- ?genetics - familial clustering; first-degree relatives are at increased risk for developing sarcoidosis (odds ratio [OR] 4.7, 95% CI 2.3-9.7)
- ?occupation - there is age-specific and sex-specific clustering; certain exposures e.g beryllium can cause granulomas similar to sarcoid granulomas
- ?infectious or environmental cause - there is seasonal clustering (more common winter, early spring); apparant transmission following lung, cardiac, and bone mx transplantation has occured

# pathology

- multisystem (usually non-caseating) granulomatous disease that involves lungs in 90% of cases
- affects upper lobes and bronchovascular bundles more than other lung compartments
- often associated with hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy
- immunopathogenesis: 
-- antigen stimulates monocyte to differenciate into antigen-presending cell (macrophage or dendritic cells). presented to CD4+ t-helper lymphocytes which amplify imnmune response through interferon-gamma, IL2, and other cytokines. Aided by tregs that also produce inteferon gamma.  Increased expression of the transcription factor T-bet and chemokine receptor CXCR3 contribute to a Th1 orientation. (Th1-type response, recall Th1 response predominantly manifest against intracellualr organisms, dominant cytokines IL2 and IFN gamma, while Th2-type response against extracellular organisms, dominant cytokine IL4).
-- further stimulation by inflamatory mediators leads to fusion of macrophages and dendritic cells into multinucleated giant cells, as granuloma matures these form a tight central cluster. metabolic checkpoint kinase (mTORC1) activation in macrophages is assoc with disease progression.
- TCR on CD4+ t-helper cells (predominant lymphocyte) could hold key to identifying antigen/understanding disease since they recognise processed antigen presented on MHCII complex. Enormous diversity of TCR acquired through somatic rearrangement of variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) segments togetehr with random addition and/or deletion of N-region nucleotides to form unique VDJ region. Studies of the TCR Vbeta repertoire in patients with active sarcoidosis has demonstrated bias in certain TCR Vbeta subsets, including Vbeta2, Vbeta8, Vbeta12, and Valpha2.3. (does it vary with antigen or with HLA class type? we don't know)
- Genome wide linkage and association studies have identified genes that may be associated with increased susceptibility to sarcoidosis, such as butyrophilin-like 2 gene (BTNL2), annexin A11 (ANXA11), and angiotensin converting enzyme variants, although the associations vary across populations.

# clinical features

## history

presentation depends on systems disease affect (90% involve lung, isolated BHL most common)
- node-limited disease is often asymptomatic; however, some present with systemic symptoms (fevers, night sweats, fatigue, weight loss, diffuse myalgia)
- BHL may accompany sarcoid uveitis, or parotitis
- Logren's syndrome consists of BHL, erythema nodosum and/or bilateral ankle arthritis
- parenchymal sardcoidosis may present with dyspnoea and cough
- non-cardiac chest pain is often characterised by chest tightness or pleuritic discomfort
- cough and exertional dyspnoea common in advanced sarcoidosis
- accuarate
